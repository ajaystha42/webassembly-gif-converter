# webassembly-gif-converter
This is the react-app which converts video into gif using `@ffmpeg/ffmpeg` library which is a JavaScript wrapper around the `FFmpeg` library compiled to `WebAssembly`, allowing you to run `FFmpeg` commands directly in the browser using `Wasm`.

The usage of `@ffmpeg/ffmpeg` library in the provided code demonstrates how `WebAssembly` can be used to bring powerful multimedia processing capabilities, such as video conversion, to the browser without requiring server-side processing.
